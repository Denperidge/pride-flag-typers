# Pride Flag Typers

A project based on a [sadly now unavailable tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20200712210219/https://twitter.com/linodykes/status/1282400104356417537) but archived & expanded upon in a [delightful Tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/calierthewolf/715868902662569984/if-a-terf-even-looks-at-this-they-will-die-in). Create the most beautiful or horrid pride flags you can imagine, the world is your oyster!

If you want to test out the project, it's hosted online on [flags.neonpastel.net](https://flags.neonpastel.net)! If you want to run it locally or contribute, feel free to read further.

## How-To
### Run locally
Make sure you have Git & Node.js installed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denperidge/pride-flag-typers.git  # Clone the repository
cd pride-flag-typers/
npm install  # Install requirements
npm start  # Run a development server on localhost:1234
```

Instead of `npm start`, you can use `npm run build` to build the files without the webserver part!
